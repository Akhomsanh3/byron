<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>Byron is a game in which you play a series of tic-tac-toe contests against a computer opponent while you race against the clock. For each game you play, the clock starts counting down from 10 seconds to 0. If you beat the computer, you earn points based on the time remaining. The faster you play, the more points you earn. you receive 1/4 point for every second remaining on the clock. If you beat the computer in 3 seconds, you earn 1.75 points.</p>
<p>You begin the game with five "lives." A life is lost each time the computer wins a game. Byron is over when you have no lives remaining. During the course of play, you have a chance to earn additional lives through scoring bonuses.</p>
<p><b>Play</b></p>
<p>Byron plays like a normal tic-tac-toe game. The goal is to get three marks in a row. Byron goes first. He plays "O" and you play "X". You can select a square by clicking it with your mouse. When the game is over, you can start a new one by clicking anywhere on the board. (Or you can hit the reset button). There are three possible outcomes to every game:
<ul>
  <li>Byron wins - when this occurs, you lose a life. When your lives count down to zero, the game is over.</li>
  <li>You win! - when this occurs you get 1/4 point for every second remaining on the clock. If you beat Byron in three seconds, you earn 1.75 points.</li>
  <li>Tie - nothing happens. You earn no points and you lose no lives.</li> 
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Bonuses</b></p>
<p>There are two types of bonuses you can earn, a point bonus and an efficiency bonus. The former is rewarded based on accumulated points. The latter is earned during a single game:
<ul>
  <li>Points - you receive a new life for every 25 points you earn. You cannot exceed five lives. If you earn 25 points with five lives remaining, then nothing happens. But if you earn an additional 25 points with four or less lives remaining, then you earn an additional one.</li>
  <li>Efficiency - If you can beat the computer in exactly three moves, you receive double points for every second left on the clock. If you win in three moves in three seconds, you earn 3.5 points instead of 1.75</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Players</b></p>
<p>There are two types of Byron players. One begins life in a rather stupid state but learns from its mistakes. The other begins life as smart as it will every be. It plays as well in its last game as it did in its first:
<ul>
  <li>M.E.N.A.C.E. is based on Donald Michie's Machine Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine (MENACE) engine.  That was a "computer" constructed of match boxes which was capable of "learning" Tic Tac Toe. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Michie </li>
  <li>Minimax - is a decision theory concept designed to MINImize a possible loss for a MAXimum loss scenario.</li>
</ul>
In the grand scheme of things, M.E.N.A.C.E. provides a more interesting contest but Minimax is for manly men who like manly challenges.
